\section{Review}
\par Answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item In few sentences state the objectives of this class.
\item Name the central areas of the theory of computation. Define each area in one/two sentence(s).
\item Think of a real-life problem (A) that can be reduced to another problem (B) which you have already learnt in the some of the previous classes.
\item We have two problems at hand:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Sort the list of enrolled students of a class in alphabetic order of their names.
 \item From an undirected graph, find the largest clique. \emph {(Note: A clique of a graph G is a complete subgraph of G.)}
\end{enumerate}
Are both of the problems equally difficult? Why/why not? Just put down your thoughts. Your statement (at least at this moment) does not have to me mathematically proven.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proof Techniques}
Using either construction/contradiction/induction strategy, prove that

\begin{theorem*}
Two integers $a$ and $b$ are consecutive if and only if $b = a + 1$. You can safely assume that $b > a$.
\subsection{Solution: {\bf Proof by Contradiction}}
Let us assume that $a$ and $b$ are two consecutive integers and $b = a + m$, where $m \ne 1$. \\
Since $1$ is the smallest positive integer, we assume that $m > 1$. Now if we look at the natural number series,
 there are $(m-1)$ distinct number, $a+1, a+2, \dots , a+ (m-1)$, between $a$ and $b$.
 Hence,  we arrive at the decision that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive if and only if $m = 1$.  
\end{theorem*}
