\section{Review}
\par Answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
\item In few sentences state the objectives of this class.
\item Name the central areas of the theory of computation. Define each area in one/two sentence(s).
\item Think of a real life problem (A) that can be reduced to another problem (B) which you have already learnt in the some of the previous classes.
\item We have two problems in hand:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Sort the list of enrolled students in alphabetic order of their names.
 \item From an undirected graph, find the largest clique.
\end{enumerate}
Are both of the problems equally difficult? Why/why not?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proof Techniques}
Using either construction/contradiction/induction strategy, prove that

\begin{theorem*}
Two integers $a$ and $b$ are consecutive if and only if $b = a + 1$ 
\end{theorem*}
